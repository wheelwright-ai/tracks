"""Auto-eject savepoint: the EXISTENCE guarantee half of the savepoint resume
contract (impl-savepoint-loss-safety-net-v1, spec-savepoint-resume-contract-v1).

v4's validate_savepoint.py guarantees a savepoint's QUALITY once written, but
nothing guaranteed one gets written AT ALL — savepoint creation lived only inside
/wai-closeout, which a session can skip (context blowout, abandon, /clear, crash).
A session ending any other way lost 100% of its resume state. This tool is the
Stop-time safety net: when a session ends with substantive unfinished work and no
savepoint exists for it, write a DEGRADED-but-DURABLE auto-eject savepoint so the
next session resumes from disk instead of archaeology.

HARNESS-MODE-AWARE (works in both trees, one file):
  v3 working base = <root>/WAI-Spoke
  v4 working base = <root>/WAI-Harness/spoke/local
Mode selection mirrors .claude/hooks/harness_mode.sh: explicit WAI_HARNESS_MODE
override wins, else prefer v4 when present, else v3.

The auto-eject savepoint is stamped status='auto-eject' + degraded=true and carries
an honest_flag that it is machine-reconstructed and may be incomplete. It is EXEMPT
from validate_savepoint.py's full hard gate (a degraded record beats nothing), but
it is a real, on-disk, resume-path-visible savepoint.

CLI:
    python3 tools/auto_eject_savepoint.py --session <id> [--root DIR]
        [--mode v3|v4] [--dry-run]
    exit 0 always (a safety net never blocks Stop); prints a JSON status line.

    Canonical home: the top-level `_savepoint` key inside {base}/WAI-State.json (NOT a
    standalone pointer file) -- this mirrors wakeup-canonical.sh's own _write_state(),
    which already writes _session_state into the same file under the same lock, and
    matches the pointer shape already live in WAI-State.json from this session's manual
    savepoint update: {savepoint_id, path, lug_id, initiative_id, status, ts}.

    Locking: fcntl.flock on {base}/runtime/.waistate.lock -- the exact lock file
    wakeup-canonical.sh already serializes WAI-State.json writes through (see
    wakeup-canonical.sh's `( flock 9; _write_state ) 9>"$BASE/runtime/.waistate.lock"`).
    Write is atomic: build the full merged dict, write to a tmp file, os.replace() into
    place -- no partial-write window is ever observable.

    Best-effort by design: any exception here must never propagate to the caller. A
    pointer-write failure degrades gracefully (the savepoint file itself already landed
    safely) rather than becoming a new single point of failure for the auto-eject path.

    DEFERENCE RULE: an auto-eject pointer must never clobber an unresumed authored
    savepoint. The safety net's premise is "a degraded record beats nothing" -- when a
    `status: pending` pointer is already live, the alternative is not nothing, it is a
    human-authored resume contract that no session has consumed yet. Overwriting it
    silently loses the operator's actual next step and replaces it with a machine
    reconstruction explicitly stamped "treat as a lead, not a contract".

    So when the live pointer is `pending`, we KEEP it and park ours under
    `_savepoint_autoeject` instead. The auto-eject savepoint FILE still lands either way
    -- that is where the safety net's value actually is -- only the resume pointer defers.
