## PEV Chain Pattern — Examples

### Chain Structure

| Role | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `perceive` | Frames the problem: evidence, conditions, unknowns | `pev_role`, `pev_chain_id`, `evidence[]`, `conditions[]` |
| `execute` | Records intended action or implementation plan | `pev_role`, `pev_chain_id`, `plan`, `target_files[]` |
| `verify` | Defines proof the work is correct | `pev_role`, `pev_chain_id`, `criteria[]`, `verified_at` |

### JSON Example

```json
{"id": "pev-auth-perceive", "type": "work", "pev_role": "perceive", "pev_chain_id": "pev-auth-20260322", "title": "Auth system: problem framing", "evidence": ["Users can bypass 2FA via API"], "conditions": ["Only affects API endpoints, not web UI"]}
{"id": "pev-auth-execute", "type": "work", "pev_role": "execute", "pev_chain_id": "pev-auth-20260322", "title": "Auth system: implementation plan", "plan": "Add 2FA enforcement middleware to API router"}
{"id": "pev-auth-verify", "type": "work", "pev_role": "verify", "pev_chain_id": "pev-auth-20260322", "title": "Auth system: verification criteria", "criteria": ["API requests without valid 2FA token receive 403", "Existing web UI 2FA flow unchanged"]}
```

## Canonical Type System — work.kind Example

## Lug ID Generation — Extended Example

```
sha256("Fix authentication timeout") = 4f1e687a652f...
i = "4f1e687a652f"
```

  "ty": "task",
  "t": "Fix authentication timeout in session middleware",
  "s": "o",
  "ca": "2026-02-28T10:00:00Z",

## Victory Briefing Format

After a lug or epic is implemented and verified, present a Victory Briefing to the user.

### Format

1. **Header:** `### EPIC WIN: {Title}` or `### LUG CLOSED: {Title}`
2. **The Human Why:** 1-2 paragraphs explaining what was built and *why it matters*. Focus on value, not code.
3. **The Stats:**
   - **Complexity:** Low | Medium | High
   - **Impact:** 1-10
   - **Files Touched:** count
   - **Verification:** brief summary of tests passed
4. **The "Check it Out":** A specific command or file the user can inspect.

## WAI-Challenges.jsonl

First-class append-only file for stable problem statements, independent of hypotheses (idea lugs) that address them.

### Schema

```json
{
  "i": "chal-{3-5-word-slug}",
  "ty": "challenge",
  "statement": "The stable problem text — refined after wai-improve Step 3",
  "first_seen": "ISO-8601",
  "first_seen_in": "idea lug ID of the first idea that identified this challenge",
  "status": "open | resolved | deferred",
  "related_lugs": ["idea and epic IDs addressing this challenge"],
  "resolution_notes": "How it was resolved (if status=resolved)"
}
```

**Append-only:** Latest entry per `i` wins.

**Lifecycle:** Created by `/wai-improve` Step 3b on first intake of a challenge. Updated each time a new idea links to it.

**Relationship to ideas:** Challenge = stable problem. Idea = one hypothesis. One challenge can have many ideas across sessions and models. The `challenge_id` field on an idea lug is the link back.

**Slug generation:** Take 3–5 meaningful words (nouns, verbs — skip stopwords), join with hyphens, lowercase.
Example: `"Recurring friction across sessions is invisible"` → `chal-recurring-friction-invisible`

## AI Workflow with Lugs

1. **Wakeup** — Browse open lugs (s=o, s=p) to understand priorities
2. **Session** — Create lugs for sub-tasks or newly discovered bugs
3. **Autosave** — Checkpoint lugs with `ty: "autosave"` and `reconciled: false`
4. **Closeout** — Reconcile autosaves, signal high-impact items, update status

## Ozi Gardening Lug Types

Ozi automation history lives in these lug types — **not** in WAI-State.json.

### ozi-controller

One Ozi automation pass or bounded task batch.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `id` | `ozi-ctrl-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}-{task-slug}` |
| `type` | `"ozi-controller"` |
| `title` | What Ozi is orchestrating |
| `session_id` | Session that created this controller |
| `target_lug_id` | Implementation or task lug being worked |
| `status` | `active \| completed \| failed` |
| `work_lug_ids` | Child ozi-work lug ids |
| `test_lug_ids` | Paired ozi-test lug ids |
| `created_at` | ISO-8601 |
| `completed_at` | ISO-8601 or null |

### ozi-work

One discrete unit of work dispatched by an Ozi controller.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `id` | `ozi-work-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}-{task-slug}` |
| `type` | `"ozi-work"` |
| `controller_id` | Parent ozi-controller lug id |
| `task` | Concise description of what was done |
| `target_file` | File or resource modified |
| `status` | `completed \| failed \| skipped` |
| `result` | Short outcome note |
| `created_at` | ISO-8601 |
| `completed_at` | ISO-8601 or null |

### ozi-test

Paired verification record. Required before any ozi-work lug can move to `ready_for_recheck`.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `id` | `ozi-test-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}-{task-slug}` |
| `type` | `"ozi-test"` |
| `work_lug_id` | Parent ozi-work lug id |
| `test_command` | Runnable shell or Python verification command |
| `expected` | Expected output or behaviour |
| `actual` | Observed result |
| `result` | `pass \| fail \| skip` |
| `tested_at` | ISO-8601 |

**Rule:** Every ozi-work lug must have a paired ozi-test lug.

## Anti-Pattern Examples

### Ambiguous action (bad)
```json
{"action": "implement_feature"}
```

### Explicit intent (good)
```json
{"request_type": "work_item_tracking", "work_description": "Add caching layer to API", "do_not_execute_automatically": true}
```

### Implicit context (bad)
```json
{"task": "Update the config"}
```

### Self-contained (good)
```json
{"task_type": "configuration_change", "target_file": "WAI-Spoke/WAI-State.json", "change_description": "Add hub_analysis section with spoke_count and last_sync fields", "tracking_only": true}
```
