## Use Cases

**Use Case 1: New Project**
- Situation: First AI session, no foundation exists
- Action: Run foundation to establish identity, goals, boundaries
- Result: Foundation lug v1 created, work can begin

**Use Case 2: Scope Expansion**
- Situation: User wants to add features outside original scope
- Action: Run foundation to evolve boundaries with rationale
- Result: Foundation lug v(n+1) captures change and why

**Use Case 3: Pivot**
- Situation: Project purpose fundamentally shifts
- Action: Run foundation to capture new identity
- Result: Evolution chain shows the journey

**Use Case 4: Onboarding New AI**
- Situation: Different AI/session needs project context
- Action: Query foundation lugs for current state + history
- Result: AI understands project personality and evolution

```

### Why Did Scope Change?
```
lugs where ty="foundation" AND v > 1 | read rationale chain
```
