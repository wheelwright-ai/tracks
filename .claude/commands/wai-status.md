# WAI Status

Health check with hub connection, sync age, session health, recommendations.

## What It Does

Quick snapshot of project health:

1. **Hub connection** — Connected? Last sync when?
2. **Session health** — Current turn count, context usage
3. **Recommendations** — What action to take (closeout? teach? sync?)

Lightweight check, complements full /wai briefing.

## When to Use

- **Quick check:** After 10+ turns
- **Uncertain sync:** Hub out of date?
- **Decision point:** Should I closeout or continue?
- **Health monitoring:** Periodic during long sessions

## How It Works

### Step 1: Ozi Work Queue Check (If Enabled)

If `ozi-work-queue-monitor` skill is enabled, show Ozi's queue view first:

```bash
# Run Ozi's quick status
python3 wai_ozi.py
```

This shows one of two views:
- interactive mode: work needing attention, active work, ready work
- auto mode: ready queue, work claimed by this session, recent dispatch activity

When Ozi auto mode is enabled for the current session, keep the output builder-focused and avoid broad user-interaction prompts.

### Step 2: System Health Check

1. Check hub connection status from WAI-State.json
2. Calculate sync age (now - last_sync)
3. Check session metrics:
   - Current turn count
   - Context usage percentage
   - Files modified in this session
4. Generate recommendations based on thresholds:
   - context > 70% → recommend closeout
   - hub_sync > 7 days → recommend teach
   - turn_count > 20 → recommend context check
